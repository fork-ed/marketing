Let me tell you about my hell. I'm a new teacher at a university. I've just come from one where I designed 
and taught a course with my friend Jim. At my new university I've just been asked to teach two technology courses at short notice that are hopelessly outdated.

But we want to flip the classroom, and redesign our whole degree for the brave new world where students expect better courses than they ever have before.

What if I didn't have to rebuild the course from an empty page. What if I could simply click a button, and Jim's and my course splits. We both have it. What if we could see how each the changes we make to our courses, and pull and push them in.  

I know who the heroes in my field are. Who my trusted colleagues are. I don't want to have to search some massive repositories of open content on twitter, edmodo, or even open courseware, and piece it all together. I want to be able to clone and tweak my friend's courses. I want them to be able to copy mine. I want us to be able to work together.

Right now education is more and more open for students taking courses. But we're tweak-ed and we want to bring the revolution of openness to how teachers create and update their courses.

I teach my students to collaborate. Surely I should be able to do it collaboratively.

I'm not alone. Armando teaches a course at Berkely. His teaching assistant went to Hawaii and teaches it there. But the infrastructure doesn't help us do it. My friend Peter uses a MOOC as a resource in his course. But it's just recommended reading because he can't adjust it to fit what he wants to teach without rebuilding the whole dang thing.

Education is at the stage the software world was before GitHub. It's becomming more open. But it hasn't got the sharing model, how we pull and push our changes, right yet. And now we're really starting to need it.

Teachers don't create everything from scratch. 
They share content and resources all the time, on Facebook, edModo, twitter, in person. 
But at the moment, it's all fairly ad hoc, it's a mess -- we can see what our friends happen to click share on. 
But we can't see their courses -- what they're actually using, and what they've stopped using.
