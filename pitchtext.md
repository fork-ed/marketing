Right now education is more and more open for students taking courses. But we're tweak-ed and we make the revolution of openness really work for university teachers.

Can I tell you my pain? I'm a new teacher at a university. I've just come from one where I designed 
and taught a course with my friend Jim. At my new university I've just been asked to teach two technology courses at short notice that are hopelessly outdated. And I have to build this course manually.

And we have to flip the classroom, and redesign our whole degree for this brave new world where students expect much more from their courses than they ever have before. 

If this was publishing papers, they'd be cited, and my h-index that academics are promoted on, would go up. But even though universities care more about teaching, and there's more pressure on academics to flip the classroom, change their courses for a new teaching model, there's no citation index for teaching.

What if all that changed.

What if Jim and I could click a button, and Jim's and my course splits. We both have it. What if we could see how each the changes we make to our courses, and pull and push them in.  

Armando's teaching assistant went to Hawaii, and teaches the course there. What if he could click a button to clone it and it counted as a citation for Armando?

What if my friend Peter could clone the MOOC that he sets as a reading assignment in his course, and tweak it so it really fits his course.

I teach my students to collaborate. Surely I should be able to do it collaboratively. Surely all this content we're publishing should count like publications do.

Education is at the stage the software world was before GitHub. It's becomming more open. But it hasn't got the sharing model, how we pull and push our changes, right yet. And now we're really starting to need it.

Teachers don't create everything from scratch. 
They share content and resources all the time, on Facebook, edModo, twitter, in person. 
But at the moment, it's all fairly ad hoc, it's a mess -- we can see what our friends happen to click share on. 
But we can't see their courses -- what they're actually using, and what they've stopped using.
